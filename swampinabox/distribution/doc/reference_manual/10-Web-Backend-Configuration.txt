SWAMP Web Application Backend Configuration
-------------------------------------------

The file `/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env` contains various parameter names
and values that are used to configure the SWAMP web application's backend.
You must have `root` access to modify this file.

[IMPORTANT]
This file should be readable only by the `apache` system user. It should
*never* be world readable, because it contains usernames and passwords for
accessing various resources.

The remainder of this section describes the parameters. Some descriptions
refer to https://laravel.com/[Laravel], which is the framework that the
backend is built upon.


[[backend-web-app]]
Web Application Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`APP_ENV`::

A description of the SWAMP's environment. This parameter is informational
and does not affect the functioning of the backend. The SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer sets this to "SWAMP-in-a-Box".

`APP_DEBUG`::

Whether verbose debugging is enabled. When set to "true", unexpected errors
in the backend return a detailed error page. When set to "false", such
errors return a page that says, "Whoops, looks like something went wrong."
The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "false".

`APP_URL`::

The URL used to access the SWAMP's web application routes. The
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this based on the hostname specified during
the install process (usually, the host's detected hostname).

+
When the hostname changes, use the `/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_set_web_host`
utility script to update this parameter, because that script will update not
only this parameter but also all other configuration locations where the
hostname is referenced.

`APP_CORS_URL`::

The URL used to access the SWAMP's web site. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer
sets this based on the hostname specified during the install process
(usually, the host's detected hostname).

+
When the hostname changes, use the `/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_set_web_host`
utility script to update this parameter, because that script will update not
only this parameter but also all other configuration locations where the
hostname is referenced.

`APP_FLOODLIGHT`::

The URL and port of the Floodlight server to contact. This is not applicable
to a SWAMP-in-a-Box installation.

`APP_INCOMING`::

The path to the directory used to temporarily store files uploaded for new
packages. This should always be set to "/swamp/incoming/".

`APP_KEY`::

An encryption key used by the Laravel framework. Allowed values are any 16
or 32 character string. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to a random
32 character string.

`APP_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTION_METHOD`::

The encryption method used to hash user passwords before either storing them
in the SWAMP's SQL database or sending them to an LDAP server. Allowed
values are "BCRYPT", "SSHA", "SHA1", and "NONE". The SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer sets this to "BCRYPT".

+
This should be set to "NONE" only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is "true",
`LDAP_READ_ONLY` is "false", and the LDAP server does its own encryption
when given a new or changed user password. This is not applicable when
`LDAP_ENABLED` is "true" and `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is "true".

`APP_PASSWORD_MAX`::

The maximum number of Application Passwords a user can create. Set this to
an integer greater than zero to allow creation of one or more Application
Passwords. Set this to zero to disallow creation of Application Passwords.
The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to 10.


HTCondor Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`HTCONDOR_COLLECTOR_HOST`::

The hostname of the HTCondor collector to contact for information about the
SWAMP's currently running assessments. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets
this to "localhost.localdomain".


[[backend-mail-settings]]
Mail Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters are related to outgoing email sent by the SWAMP web
application.

SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed with outgoing email disabled. Prior to enabling
and configuring outgoing email (instructions can be found in the
SWAMP-in-a-Box User Manual), you must first configure an outgoing email
server for use with the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

`MAIL_ENABLED`::

Whether the SWAMP web application is configured for outgoing email. Set this
to "true" or "false". When set to "false", outgoing email is disabled, and
the mail-related settings described below are not applicable. When outgoing
email is disabled, all functionality that would otherwise result in an email
being sent by the system runs without sending the email. Specifically:

  * Username is displayed instead of email throughout the web application.

  * Workflows that rely on email, such as requesting a password reset,
    are disabled.

  * Permission requests, project invitations, and SWAMP administrator
    invitations are handled exclusively through the notification system.

  * New user accounts do not go through a "pending" state and are
    instead immediately activated.

  * The option to receive an email on completion of an assessment
    is unavailable.

  * The Administrator Settings page for Restricted Domains is unavailable.

  * The Administrator Settings page for System Emails is unavailable.

  * The Contact Us and Report Security Incident pages do not include a means
    to submit a message directly through the web application.

+
The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this parameter to "false".

`MAIL_DRIVER`::

The driver used to send outgoing email. Set this to "smtp" or "sendmail".
The "smtp" driver makes connections directly to the configured SMTP server
(see the `MAIL_HOST` parameter below) to deliver email messages. The
"sendmail" driver uses the host's postfix mail system to deliver email
messages.

+
With the "smtp" driver, when sending a message, the SWAMP web application
will wait for an acknowledgment that the message was sent. With the
"sendmail" driver, the SWAMP web application will *not* necessarily wait for
an acknowledgment. Instead, if there are issues with the initial attempt to
send the message, the web application will rely on postfix to continue
attempting to deliver the message in the background.

+
We recommend using the "sendmail" driver.

`MAIL_HOST`::

The hostname of the SMTP server. This is applicable only if `MAIL_DRIVER` is
set to "smtp".

`MAIL_PORT`::

The port to connect to on the SMTP server. This is applicable only if
`MAIL_DRIVER` is set to "smtp".

`MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`::

The email address to be used as the sender of outgoing SWAMP email.

`MAIL_FROM_NAME`::

The name to be used as the sender of outgoing SWAMP email.

`MAIL_CONTACT_ADDRESS`::

The email address to which messages submitted via the Contact Us page are
sent. Use this to direct contact messages to a specific administrator or
help desk. This address is also displayed in the content of some SWAMP
emails.

`MAIL_CONTACT_NAME`::

The name to which messages submitted via the Contact Us page are sent.

`MAIL_SECURITY_ADDRESS`::

The email address to which messages submitted via the Report Security
Incident page are sent. Use this to direct security messages to a specific
administrator or help desk. This address is also displayed in the content of
some SWAMP emails.

`MAIL_SECURITY_NAME`::

The name to which messages submitted via the Report Security Incident page
are sent.

`MAIL_ENCRYPTION`::

If `MAIL_DRIVER` is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server uses encryption, set
this to the type of encryption used. Otherwise, set this to "null".

`MAIL_USERNAME`::

If `MAIL_DRIVER` is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server requires
a username/password, set this to the username. Otherwise, set this to
"null".

`MAIL_PASSWORD`::

If `MAIL_DRIVER` is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server requires
a username/password, set this to the password. Otherwise, set this to
"null".


LDAP Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters are related to configuring an LDAP server to store
user-related personal information for a SWAMP instance. When the SWAMP is
not configured to use an LDAP server, as is the case when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
initially installed, user-related personal information is stored in the
SWAMP's SQL database.

`LDAP_ENABLED`::

Whether the SWAMP uses an LDAP server for user authentication and storing of
user data. When set to "false", a record is created for each SWAMP user in
the `project` database. When set to "true", a record is created for each
SWAMP user in the LDAP server. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to
"false".

`LDAP_PASSWORD_VALIDATION`::

Whether verification of a user's password on sign-in is done by LDAP. When
set to "true", a user's password is authenticated through an LDAP bind. When
set to "false", a user's password is authenticated in PHP by comparing it to
the hash stored in LDAP.

+
Set this to "true" when LDAP is enabled and your LDAP server is able to
validate against the type of encryption used to store passwords. Set this to
"false" when LDAP is enabled and LDAP is not able to validate against the
type of encryption used to store passwords, such as when `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is
"false" and `APP_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTION_METHOD` is "BCRYPT".

+
The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "false".

`LDAP_READ_ONLY`::

Whether the SWAMP is prevented from adding or editing user records in the
LDAP server. When set to "false", the SWAMP assumes that it has total
control over user attributes and LDAP entries. In this case, the SWAMP
should be the only client of the LDAP server. When set to "true", the SWAMP
assumes that creation and editing of user attributes and LDAP entries is to
be done outside of the SWAMP. In this case, the SWAMP disables any workflows
that would result in the creation or editing of user records, including user
passwords. Specifically:

  * The sign up button is removed from the SWAMP home page. However, any
    user with a record in the LDAP server can sign in to the SWAMP, and
    supporting records in the SWAMP's SQL database will be created
    automatically on sign in.

  * The "Reset my password" link is removed from the sign-in page.

  * The Linked Account Use Policy page does not allow creation of new
    accounts, only linking to existing accounts.

  * The user profile page displays user demographics as stored in LDAP
    but does not allow them to be edited in the SWAMP web application.

  * The user profile page does not include options to change or reset
    the user's password or to delete the account.

  * The SWAMP administrator Review Accounts page does not provide options to
    flag accounts as hibernated or to require a password reset.

+
This should be set to "true" if you are using a pre-existing LDAP server.
The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "false".

`LDAP_MIR_SWAMP`::

Whether the LDAP server is configured with the schema used in the
mir-swamp.org LDAP server. Set to "true" or "false". The purpose of this
parameter is to support setting a legacy, required attribute in the LDAP
server used by mir-swamp.org. In all other cases, this should be set to
"false". The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "false".

`LDAP_HOST`::

The URL of the LDAP server to connect to, including the protocol and host,
e.g. "ldaps://ldap.example.org". The specified LDAP server must support LDAP
protocol 3. This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to "true".

`LDAP_PORT`::

The port to connect to on the configured `LDAP_HOST`. The SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer sets this to "636". This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is
set to "true".

`LDAP_BASE_DN`::

The RDN search base for LDAP searches. This needs to be set based on the
configuration of the base `dn` of the LDAP directory for your users. The
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "ow=people,o=SWAMP,dc=cosalab,dc=org".
This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to "true".

`LDAP_USER_RDN_ATTR`::

The Prefix RDN attribute for users in the LDAP server. This needs to be set
based on how `dn` fields are formed in the LDAP server. The SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer sets this to "swampUuid". This is applicable only if
`LDAP_ENABLED` is set to "true".

`LDAP_SWAMP_UID_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute to be used as an index into the SWAMP database. This must
be set to an attribute that uniquely identifies each user and is
unchangeable. Often, this will be the same as `LDAP_USER_RDN_ATTR`. The
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "swampUuid". This is applicable only
if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to "true".

+
Note that this attribute will be used to identify users in the SWAMP's web
application routes and, as such, will be displayed in URLs for the SWAMP's
web pages with data for a specific user.

`LDAP_FIRSTNAME_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute for users' first names. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets
this to "givenName". This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to
"true".

+
If `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "true" and your LDAP server does not have an
attribute for users' first names, set this to "ignore". If `LDAP_READ_ONLY`
is set to "false", this attribute can be edited through the SWAMP web
interface.

`LDAP_LASTNAME_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute for users' last names. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets
this to "sn" (surname). This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to
"true".

+
If `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "true" and your LDAP server does not have an
attribute for users' last names, set this to "ignore". If `LDAP_READ_ONLY`
is set to "false", this attribute can be edited through the SWAMP web
interface.

`LDAP_FULLNAME_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute for users' full names. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets
this to "cn" (common name). This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set
to "true".

+
If your LDAP server does not have an attribute for users' full names, set
this to "ignore". If `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false", the SWAMP will
generally set this attribute to either the first and last name of the given
user or to "none". It is not directly editable in the SWAMP web interface.

`LDAP_PASSWORD_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute for users' passwords. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets
this to "userPassword". This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to
"true".

+
If `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false", a user will be able to set a password
on signing up for the SWAMP and later be able to change it through the SWAMP
web interface.

`LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute to be mapped to the SWAMP username. The SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer sets this to "uid". This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is
set to "true".

+
This must be set to an attribute that uniquely identifies each user. If
`LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false", this attribute can be edited through the
SWAMP web interface as long as the new value is unique.

`LDAP_EMAIL_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute for users' email addresses. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer
sets this to "mail". This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to
"true".

+
If `EMAIL_ENABLED` is set to "true" and `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false",
this attribute can be edited through the SWAMP web interface. If
`LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false" and `EMAIL_ENABLED` is also set to
"false", you can set `LDAP_EMAIL_ATTR` to "ignore" and the SWAMP will not
set it. Otherwise, the SWAMP will set the email attribute in LDAP to
a single space character.

`LDAP_ORG_ATTR`::

The LDAP attribute for users' affiliations. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer
sets this to "o" (organization). This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED`
is set to "true".

+
This should be an optional attribute in LDAP. If `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to
"true" and your LDAP server does not have an attribute for users'
affiliations, set this to "ignore". If `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false",
this attribute can be edited through the SWAMP web interface.

`LDAP_OBJECTCLASS`::

A comma-separated list of "objectClass" attributes to be set for each user.
Set this to a comma-separated list of the "objectClass" attributes required
by the LDAP server. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to
"top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson,eduPerson,swampEntity", which
defines the following "objectClass" attributes:

  * objectClass: top

  * objectClass: person

  * objectClass: organizationalPerson

  * objectClass: inetOrgPerson

  * objectClass: eduPerson

  * objectClass: swampEntity

+
This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to "true" and
`LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false".

`LDAP_WEB_USER`::

The full `dn` of a credentialed LDAP user with global LDAP read access. The
SWAMP web server uses this to get information about SWAMP users from LDAP.
This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to "true".

`LDAP_WEB_USER_PASSWORD`::

The password for `LDAP_WEB_USER`. This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED`
is set to "true".

`LDAP_PASSWORD_SET_USER`::

The full `dn` of a credentialed LDAP user with permission to change other
users' passwords. The SWAMP web server uses this to create and change user
passwords in LDAP. This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED` is set to
"true" and `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false".

`LDAP_PASSWORD_SET_USER_PASSWORD`::

The password for `LDAP_SET_USER`. This is applicable only if `LDAP_ENABLED`
is set to "true" and `LDAP_READ_ONLY` is set to "false".


Third-Party Login Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters can be set to allow users to sign in using credentials from
third-party sites. Supported third-party sites are: GitHub, Google, and
CILogon. Each site has a corresponding set of parameters; in the
descriptions below, replace `[SITE]` with either `GITHUB`, `GOOGLE`, or
`CILOGON`.

SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed with third-party logins disabled. Prior to
enabling third-party logins for a site, you must set up a corresponding
OAuth Application with the site (instructions can be found in the
SWAMP-in-a-Box User Manual).

`[SITE]_ENABLED`::

Whether the SWAMP web application allows signing in via the given site. When
set to "true", the SWAMP provides a means to sign up and sign in via an
account with the site. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "false".

`[SITE]_CLIENT_ID`::

The Client ID set in the OAuth Application for the site. This is applicable
only when `[SITE]_ENABLED` is set to "true".

`[SITE]_CLIENT_SECRET`::

The Client Secret set in the OAuth Application for the site. This is
applicable only when `[SITE]_ENABLED` is set to "true".


Session Related Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters determine how session (logon) cookies behave.

`SESSION_DRIVER`::

The driver used to manage session data. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets
this to "cookie". This should not be changed.

`SESSION_LIFETIME`::

Determines the expiration date for SWAMP session cookies, in minutes, from
the time they are issued. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "2160"
(36 hours). Set this to "0" if you are setting `SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE` to
"true".

`SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE`::

Whether SWAMP session cookies expire when the browser session ends. The
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "false". Before changing this to
"true", set `SESSION_LIFETIME` to "0".

`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`::

The name of the SWAMP session cookie. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this
to "swamp_session".

`SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`::

The name of the domain for the session cookie. Set this to "null" to use the
same domain name as `APP_URL`. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to
"null".

`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`::

Whether SWAMP session cookies are sent for encrypted connections only. The
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "true".


Database Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters provide the SWAMP web application with access to the
SWAMP's SQL databases. There is a set of parameters for each of the
following databases: `project`, `package`, `tool`, `platform`, `assessment`,
and `viewer`. Each database has a corresponding set of parameters; in the
descriptions below, replace `[DB]` with `PROJECT`, `PACKAGE`, `TOOL`,
`PLATFORM`, `ASSESSMENT`, or `VIEWER`.

`[DB]_HOST`::

The hostname of the database server. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this
to "localhost".

`[DB]_PORT`::

The port to connect to on the database server. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer
sets this "3306".

`[DB]_DATABASE`::

The name of the database ("project", "package", "tool", "platform",
"assessment", or "viewer") for which the set of parameters applies.

`[DB]_USERNAME`::

The database user whose credentials will be used by the SWAMP web
application to access the database. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this
to "web".

`[DB]_PASSWORD`::

The password for the database user above for accessing the database. The
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to the password entered during the
install process.


Miscellaneous Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters control various operations of the Laravel framework. Their
values should not be changed from the ones set by the SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer.

`CACHE_DRIVER`::

The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "file".

`QUEUE_DRIVER`::

The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer sets this to "sync".
