SWAMP-in-a-Box's Filesystem
---------------------------


[[configuration-files]]
Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`/opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf`::
`/opt/swamp/etc/log4perl.conf`::
`/opt/swamp/etc/services.conf`::
`/opt/swamp/etc/swampmonitor.conf`::

SWAMP backend configuration files. Directions for modifying `swamp.conf` can
be found in the SWAMP-in-a-Box User Manual. There should be no need to
directly modify `log4perl.conf`, `services.conf`, and `swampmonitor.conf`.

`/etc/condor/condor_config`::
`/etc/condor/config.d/swampinabox_*.conf`::

HTCondor configuration files. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer preserves the
version of `condor_config` installed by the HTCondor RPMs and installs
several files into the `/etc/condor/config.d` directory. There should be no
need to directly modify any of these files.

`/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`::
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf`::

Apache configuration files. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer replaces
`httpd.conf` with a version that's included with the installer and modifies
`ssl.conf` to use more secure settings for the SSL protocols and cipher
suites than the settings installed by the `mod_ssl` RPM.

`/etc/php.ini`::

PHP configuration file. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer modifies this to allow
uploads up to 800M.


[[long-term-storage]]
Long-term Storage Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`/swamp/platforms/images`::

Directory containing the virtual machine images for performing assessments
and running the optional Code Dx viewer. The SWAMP-in-a-Box installer makes
`/var/lib/libvirt/images` a symbolic link to this directory.

`/swamp/SCAProjects`::

Directory containing assessment results. Each sub-directory contains the
results for one project.

`/swamp/store/SCAPackages`::

Directory containing package archives. Each sub-directory contains the
archive for one package version.

`/swamp/store/SCATools`::

Directory containing assessment and metric tools. The `bundled`
sub-directory contains tools that are included with the SWAMP-in-a-Box
installer. The `add-on` sub-directory contains tools that were added to the
system after the initial SWAMP-in-a-Box install.

`/var/lib/mysql`::

Directory containing MariaDB's storage files for the SWAMP's SQL databases.


[[log-files]]
Log Files
~~~~~~~~~

`/opt/swamp/log`::

Directory containing the SWAMP backend's log files.

`/var/log/condor`::
`/var/lib/condor`::

Directories containing HTCondor's log files.

`/var/log/httpd`::

Directory containing Apache's log files.

`/var/log/libvirt`::

Directory containing libvirt's log files.

`/var/log/mariadb`::

Directory containing MariaDB's log files.

`/var/www/swamp-web-server/storage/logs`::

Directory containing the SWAMP web backend's log files.


[[temporary-files]]
Temporary Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`/opt/swamp/run`::
`/swamp/working/project`::
`/swamp/working/results`::

Directories containing temporary files used by the SWAMP backend.

`/slots`::

Directory containing working directories of currently executing HTCondor
jobs.

`/swamp/incoming`::

Directory containing user-uploaded packages.

`/swamp/outgoing`::

Directory containing files that SWAMP users view or download.

`/var/lib/libvirt`::

Directory containing temporary files used by libvirt.


Reclaiming Disk Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log files can be deleted without impacting the normal functioning of the
system, although debugging issues will be more difficult if pertinent log
files are missing. Temporary files can also be deleted so long as they are
not still in use.

Deleting long-term storage files *will* impact the normal functioning of the
system. Deleting package archives, tool archives, platform images, and
assessment results will render those objects unavailable to the system, even
if they continue appear to be available in the SWAMP.
