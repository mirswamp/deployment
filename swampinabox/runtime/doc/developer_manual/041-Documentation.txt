=== Documentation ===

The SIB documentation is built separately from SIB itself.  However, the built documentation files are included within a build of a SIB release. The documentation resides in the https://github.com/mirswamp/deployment[`deployment`] repository in the `swampinabox/runtime/doc` directory.

[NOTE]
Modifications to the documentation occur in the *_GitHub Clone_*.

==== Before You Begin ====

The documentation is built using `asciidoctor` and `asciidoctor-pdf`.  Perform these steps to install these tools.  

.Install asciidoctor
----
yum install asciidoctor
----

.Install asciidoctor-pdf
----
yum install centos-release-scl-rh
yum --enablerepo=centos-sclo-rh -y install rh-ruby23
scl enable rh-ruby23 'gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre'
----

==== Building The Documentation ====

There are two types of files envolved.  The AsciiDoc source files and the generated HTML and PDF files.  Refer to https://asciidoctor.org/docs/[`Asciidoctor Documentation`] for the proper syntax for modifying the documentation.

The AsciiDoc source files are contained within subdirctories of the `swampinabox/runtime/doc` directory.  The current manuals are these:

* _SIB Administrator Manual_ in the `administrator_manual` directory
* _SIB Reference Manual_ in the `reference_manual` directory
* _SIB Developer Manual_ in the `developer_manual` directory

There is a script that is ran to generate the PDF and HTML files from the AsciiDoc sources.  This script is in the `swampinabox/distribution/util` directory.

In this example, the current directory is `swampinabox/runtime/doc`:

.build_manuals.bash Example
----
scl enable rh-ruby23 ../../distribution/util/build_manuals.bash
----

Once the `build_manuals.bash` script completes, commit the changes to the AsciiDoc sources, the HTML files, and the PDF files.  The HTML and PDF files will be included in the SIB installer.
