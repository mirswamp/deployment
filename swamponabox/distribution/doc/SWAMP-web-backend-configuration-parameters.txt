SWAMP Web Application Server Configuration
==========================================

The ".env" file
---------------
At the top level of the web server directory, you will find a file
called ".env".  This file contains the various parameter names and
values that are used to configure the SWAMP web application.  You must
have root access to modify this file.

This file contains the following parameters:

APP parameters
---------------
These are miscellaneous parameters related to the SWAMP web application.

    APP_ENV
    : a description of the SWAMP environment
    This is informational. When installing SWAMP-in-a-Box, APP_ENV is
    set to "SWAMP-in-a-Box"

    APP_DEBUG
    : whether verbose Laravel debugging is on or off
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "true", web server errors
    return a detailed error page through the Laravel framework. When
    set to "false", such errors return a page that says "whoops, looks
    like something went wrong." APP_DEBUG is set to "true" for
    SWAMP-in-a-Box.

    APP_URL
    : the URL used to access SWAMP web routes
    APP_URL is determined automatically when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed
    based on the hostname of SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

    APP_CORS_URL
    : the URL used to access the SWAMP web site
    APP_CORS_URL is determined automatically when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
    installed based on the hostname of SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

    Note: For SWAMP-in-a-Box installations the APP_URL and the
    APP_CORS_URL are the same.

    APP_KEY
    : a random encryption key used by the Laravel framework
    This can be any 16 or 32 character string. APP_KEY is set to a
    random 32 character string when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

DB parameters
-------------
These parameters provide the SWAMP web application with access to SWAMP
databases. There is a general set of parameters followed by a set of
parameters for each of the following databases:
- Project
- Package
- Tool
- Platform
- Assessment
- Viewer

    [DB]_HOST
    : the hostname for the mysql database
    This is set automatically when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed and
    should not need to be changed.

    [DB]_PORT
    : the port used to access the mysql database
    The default is port 3306. This is set automatically when
    SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed and should not need to be changed.

    [DB]_DATABASE
    : the name of each database (project, package, tool, platform,
    : assessment, or viewer) for which the set of parameters applies
    This is set automatically when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed and
    should not need to be changed.

    [DB]_USERNAME
    : the mysql user whose credentials will be used by the SWAMP web
    : application to access the database
    The default is "web". This is set automatically when SWAMP-in-a-Box
    is installed and should not need to be changed.

    [DB]_PASSWORD
    : the password for the "web" user to access the mysql database
    This is set to the database web password you specify when you
    initially install SWAMP-in-a-Box.

Miscellaneous parameters
------------------------
The following parameters are set when you install SWAMP-in-the-Box.
These settings control various opperations of the Laravel framework and
should not be changed.

    CACHE_DRIVER=file
    QUEUE_DRIVER=sync

Mail Settings
-------------
These parameters are related to outgoing email sent by the SWAMP web
applicaiton. By default, SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed with outgoing mail
disabled.

    MAIL_ENABLED
    Whether the SWAMP web application is configured for outgoing mail
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "false", outgoing mail is
    disabled and the subsequent mail-related settings are not used.
    When outgoing email is disabled, all functionality that would
    otherwise result in an email being sent by the system runs without
    sending the email. Specifically:
    - username is displayed instead of email throughout the user
      interface.
    - Permission requests, project invitations, and SWAMP admin
      invitations are handled exclusively through the new notification
      system.
    - New user accounts do not go through a "pending" state and are
      immediately activated (without need of verification).
    - The option to receive an email on completion of an assessment
      is removed.
    - The Administrator Settings page for Restricted Domains is removed.
    - The Administrator Settings page for System Emails is removed
    - Contact Us and Report Security Incident pages (if enabled) do not
      include a means to submit a message directly through the web
      interface.
    MAIL_ENABLED is set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    Note: Prior to setting MAIL_ENABLED to "true" and configuring the
    other corresponding mail settings in the .env file, you must first
    configure an outgoing email server for the SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

    MAIL_DRIVER
    : the driver used to send outgoing email.
    Set to "smtp" or "sendmail". The "sendmail" driver uses the system's
    postfix mail system to do the actual delivery of the email message.
    The "smtp" driver bypasses postfix and makes connections directly to
    your SMTP server to try and deliver the message. With the "smtp"
    driver, the UI will wait for an acknowledgment that the message was
    sent. Wheras, if there are issues sending, the "sendmail" driver via
    postfix will attempt to retry delivering of the message in the
    background without causing the UI to wait. Therefore we recommend
    using the "sendmail" driver.

    MAIL_HOST
    : the hostname of the SMTP server
    This is applicable only if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp".

    MAIL_PORT
    : the SMTP port of the SMTP server
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp".

    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
    : the email address to be used as the sender for outgoing SWAMP email

    MAIL_FROM_NAME
    : the name to be used as the sender of outgoing SWAMP email

    MAIL_CONTACT_ADDRESS
    : the email address to which messages submitted via the Contact Us
    page are sent
    Use this to direct contact messages to a specific administrator or
    help desk.

    MAIL_CONTACT_NAME
    : the name to which messages submitted via the Contact Us page are
    sent

    MAIL_SECURITY_ADDRESS
    : the email address to which messages submitted via the Report
    Security Incident page are sent
    Use this to direct security messages to a specific administrator or
    help desk.

    MAIL_SECURITY_NAME
    : the name to which messages submitted via the Report Security
    Incident page are sent

    MAIL_ENCRYPTION
    : if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server uses
    encryption, the type of encryption used
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the
    specified SMTP server uses encryption. Otherwise, set this to "null".

    MAIL_USERNAME
    : if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server requires a
    username/password, the username
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the
    specified SMTP server requires a username/password. Otherwise, set
    this to "null".

    MAIL_PASSWORD
    : if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server requires a
    username/password, the password.
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the
    specified SMTP server requires a username/password. Otherwise, set
    this to "null".

LDAP settings
-------------
These parameters are related to configuring an LDAP server to store
user-related personal information for a SWAMP instance. When SWAMP is
not configured to use an LDAP server, user-related personal information
is stored in the mysql database.
When installed, a SWAMP-in-the-Box system is not configured to use an
LDAP server.

    LDAP_ENABLED
    : whether the SWAMP web application stores user data in an LDAP
    server
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "false", a record is created
    for each SWAMP user in the project database. When set to "true", a
    record is created for each SWAMP user in the LDAP server.
    LDAP_ENABLED is set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    LDAP_HOST
    : the hostname of the LDAP server
    This is only applicable if LDAP_ENABLED is set to "true".

    LDAP_PASSWORD_SET_USER
    : the username of the LDAP user SWAMP uses to create user records in
    LDAP
    This is only applicable if LDAP_ENABLED is set to "true".

    LDAP_PASSWORD_SET_USER_PASSWORD
    : the password for the LDAP_SET_USER
    This is only applicable if LDAP_ENABLED is set to "true".

GitHub related settings
-----------------------
SWAMP can be configured to allow users to sign in with GitHub
credentials. This requires setting up an OAuth Application within
GitHub. When installed, a SWAMP-in-the-Box system is not configured to
allow GitHub sign-in.

    GITHUB_ENABLED
    : whether the SWAMP web application allows sign-in via GitHub
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "true", SWAMP provides a means
    to sign up and sign in via a GitHub account. GITHUB_ENABLED is set
    to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID

    Set it to "0" if you are setting SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE to "true".

    SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE
    : whether SWAMP session cookies expire when the session ends
    SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE is set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
    installed. SESSION_LIFETIME should be set to "0" before changing
    this to "true"

    SESSION_COOKIE_NAME
    : the name of the SWAMP session cookie
    This is set to "swamp_session" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN
